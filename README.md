# My Little impostor's algorithm

## Introduction :

**Among us** is a videogame based on a system of impostors and crewmates :
- If you're an **impostor** your role is to kill the **crewmates**, you have to simulate tasks to deceive them and do sabotages.
- If you're a **crewmate** you have to survive and make some tasks.

- If all **crewmates** died, **impostors win** (by killing, sabotaging, ...)
- If all **impostors** win when they finish their all tasks or if they unmask **impostors**.

## Why am I doing my own impostor's algorithm ?

I like to watch sometimes streamers Among us lives and I notice that sometimes :
- A streamer will be **impostor** 2 or 3 times in a row or 8 times out of 20 games
- And during this time, another streamer can be a **crewmate** during all the games and never be an **impostor**.

That's why I found this idea to create **my own impostor's algorithm** in Among us, because : I think it's a funny way for me to train my React skills.

## How does it work ?

For this project, I made at this time a button to run a game and another to reset all the games.

After that, I'll probably add many buttons as one which generate 5 or 10 games.

I'll too introduce some statistics to see if my algorithm is correctly balanced :
- for each player
- for each "run"
- for each "stream"

For the moment, I just made a simple switch() for the impostor's algorithm, but I will complexify it soon.


Thank you to look at this project.

Have a good day
